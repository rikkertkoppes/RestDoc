Apiary Blueprint Parser Test Suite
==================================

This is the Apiary blueprint parser test suite. It ensures the parser works
correctly. All tests should always pass on all supported platforms.

Running in a browser
--------------------

  1. Make sure you have Node.js and all the development dependencies specified
     in package.js installed.

  2. Run the following command in the parser root directory (one level up from
     this one):

       make browser

  3. Start a web server and make it serve the parser root directory (one level
     up from this one).

  4. Point your browser to an URL corresponding to the index.html file.

  5. Watch the tests pass (or fail).

If you have Python installed, you can fulfill steps 3 and 4 by running the
following command in the parser root directory

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

and loading http://localhost:8000/test/ in your browser.

Running from a command-line
